# Your first test
This example brings two test files, `test.py` implements a simple unit test using the python `unittest` library and `test_pytest.py` uses the 3rd part `pytest`

## You can run both by typing the following commands:

  ### Navigate to the current directory
  ```
  cd 01-basic-test-example
  ```

  ### Execute both tests with the following commands:

  ```
  python test.py
  ```
  
  or

  ```
  pytest
  ```
