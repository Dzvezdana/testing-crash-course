# Fixtures exercise

## The Exercise
Write two tests to verify the functionality of the adder class. 
The class has been designed to behave oddly if you try to make more than one instance without a fixture!

### Run and explore the app
From the current directory execute:

```
  python src/calculator.py
```

### Write the tests
 - Write the complete test suite for this special calculator class, using fixtures so it executes fast.


### To run the tests

  ```
  pytest .
  ```
