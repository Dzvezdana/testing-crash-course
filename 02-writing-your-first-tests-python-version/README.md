# Writing your first functional tests
Now is time to practice implementing few unit tests.


## The Exercise
A calculator app is provided with the 4 basic operations, based on the example from `01-basic-test-example` write unit tests for the calculator app.

### Run and explore the app
From the current directory execute:

```
  python src/calculator.py
```

### Write the tests
 - Write at least 5 unit tests using pytest
 - Write some failing tests so you get to know the error report

### Run the tests

  ```
  pytest .
  ```
